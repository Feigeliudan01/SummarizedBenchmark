Description: This package defines the SummarizedBenchmarck class, which extends 
    the RangedSummarizedExperiment object. The SummarizedBenchmark object is designed 
    to provide infrastructure to store and compare the results of different methods. 
    This class provides an integrated interface to store metadata such as parameters and software 
    versions as well as ground truths (in case these are available) and evaluation 
    metrics. It also provides an flexible way to define and evaluate new
    performance metrics.
